## General Information
The purpose of this project was to create a navigation bar that I can easily import into future projects. It can be edited to fit the theming and usage requirements for various types of websites, and any features can be easily added or removed as necessary. The navigation strikes a balance between functionality and aesthetics, ensuring that it will improve the user's ability to navigate the site while also improving the look of the website itself. I undertook this project to create a component that I can reuse in the future, and to practice my skills with the technologies used.


## Technologies Used
* Javascript 1.5
* CSS
* HTML


## Features
* The arrow menu icon expands and collapses the navigation bar when clicked.
* Smooth animations show and hide parts of the navigation bar as it changes.
* Tooltips show when a user hovers over items in the navigation bar while it's collapsed.
* A dark mode toggle switch will change the sidebar between dark/light modes.
* Some of the sidebar items will open a dropdown menu with more options when the dropdown arrows are clicked.
